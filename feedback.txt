You used PR's to contribute code to the main repository, good!
You seem to have split the exercises over the team members, good!
Every PR had at least one reviewer, good!
All CI checks completed and passed, good! 
You used projects to track progress. Also good job (not every task is closed even if the PR is completed though)
The only remark would be that you skipped reviewing the checklist. You should not complete a PR until every check has passed

Overal very good job!
